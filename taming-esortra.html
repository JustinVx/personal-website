		      <p class="lead"><em>Taming Esortra</em> is a persuasive game for people with osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a common joint disease with joint stiffness and pain as the most important symptoms; making it hard and painful for patients to exercise. However, exercise is important and can actually stop the disease from getting worse. Taming Esortra uses big data, narrative game-elements and self-monitoring to help patients gain control over their disease. With the help of Taming Esortra the user can gain insight in their personal burden caused by osteoarthritis and see how they can decrease that burden through exercise. The product was created as part of my graduation thesis and received one of the highest grades in the year.</p>

		  		<p>The graduation project is seen as the masterpiece of the Design for Interaction Master's program. I eventually distilled what I wanted to do into a project related to <em>care</em> and <em>gamification</em>. Subsequently I was able to link two different parties with the help of my chair. On the one hand there was <a href="http://www.bigr.nl">BIGR</a>, a research group at the Erasmus Medical Centre Rotterdam, that was developing a model to predict the joint disease osteoarthritis and was interested in new ways to use data in order to deal with and prevent this disease. On the other hand there was 1Minuut, a healthcare innovation start-up, that was interested in helping build new solutions within the field of healthcare. This was how the project was born.</p>

		  		<p>I started with research. Considering this was part of my graduation thesis, the research part was going to be extensive. I looked into osteoarthritis, into modernization in healthcare, into behavior change and motivation and into eHealth and gamification.</p>
		  		<p>In order to be able to come up with a successful design, my first step was to to understand what osteoarthritis is and the impact it can have on the life of a patient. I did some literature research into the subject and I also interviewed a number of experts — among them a rheumatologist, a specialized nurse and a motion researcher. This lead to a number of important findings.</p>

		  		<p>After looking at the impact of osteoarthritis on the life of the patient, I investigated the broader perspective of the doctor. I focused on understanding the current healthcare system and some of its disadvantages — especially in relation to chronic diseases — and the possible role of eHealth in addressing those disadvantages.</p>
		  		<p>I found that the medical model has been very successful in curing disease, but not necessarily in the prevention of health problems and in dealing with people that have a chronic disease. While life expectancy has grown enormously, so has the number of people with at least one chronic disease. Improvement in chronic diseases comes mostly from an improved lifestyle and environment. This is also where there is a possible role for eHealth, which may help in the transition to a new form of healthcare that is not exclusively focused on curing diseases.</p>

		  		<p>With a bigger understanding of osteoarthritis, of the healthcare system and of eHealth, the next step was to understand how to motivate someone to change his or her behavior. With this goal in mind I did a literature study into the history of behavior research and behavior change theories. I spent a lot of time researching the topic because it is interesting, difficult and also the key to a successful design. </p>
		  		<p>I looked at anything from from research on conditioning during the time of behaviorism, to the modern theories of social cognitive theory and self-determination theory, theories about goal-directed and habitual processes, about heuristics and biases and about narrative and transportation. It would to be to expansive to post all of the findings from this research, but the major findings can be found below.</p>

		  		<h4>Major findings from literature study on behavior change:</h4>
		  		<ol> 
		  			<li>A self-reinforcing loop arises when a reward gets triggered by the result of its own reinforcement. This can snowball a change in behavior.</li>
		  			<li>Three innate psychological needs are the basis for self-motivation — the needs for competence, for relatedness and for autonomy.</li>
		  			<li>Innate needs are more successful at changing behavior, as opposed to external rewards.</li>
		  			<li>Habits can be created through extensive operant conditioning.</li>
		  			<li>People have cognitive biases, which means they make decisions that are predictably irrational.</li>
		  			<li>Narrative can help to motivate and support behavior change, by circumventing confirmation bias and other cognitive biases.</li>
		  			<li>Attitude and behavior can change as a result of a change in someone's personal narrative.</li>

		  		<p>In the final part of the research phase I focused on finding out how all the previously gained knowledge could be used with the help of gamification. Gamification is the use of game elements in a non-game context. What I am focusing on is a persuasive game. Persuasive game design is game design that aims to create a user experienced game world which changes the user behavior in the real world. This happens with a transfer effect: the effect of an experienced game world on the behavior or attitude of the user in the real world.</p>
