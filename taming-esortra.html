		      <p class="lead"><em>Taming Esortra</em> is a persuasive game for people with osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a common joint disease with joint stiffness and pain as the most important symptoms; making it hard and painful for patients to exercise. However, exercise is important and can actually stop the disease from getting worse. Taming Esortra uses big data, narrative game-elements and self-monitoring to help patients gain control over their disease. With the help of Taming Esortra the user can gain insight in their personal burden caused by osteoarthritis and see how they can decrease that burden through exercise. The product was created as part of my graduation thesis and received one of the highest grades in the year.</p>

		  		<p>The graduation project is seen as the masterpiece of the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/dfi/msc-design-for-interaction/">Design for Interaction</a> Master's program. The first stepping was figuring out what I wanted it to be about. Through a lot of talks and exploration I distilled this into a project related to <em>care</em> and <em>gamification</em>. Subsequently I was able to link two different parties with the help of my chair. On the one hand there was <a href="http://www.bigr.nl">BIGR</a>, a research group at the <a href="https://www.erasmusmc.nl">Erasmus Medical Centre Rotterdam</a>, that was developing a model to predict the joint disease osteoarthritis and was interested in new ways to use data in order to deal with and prevent this disease. On the other hand there was <a href="https://1minuut.com">1Minuut</a>, a healthcare innovation start-up, that was interested in helping to build new solutions within the field of healthcare. This was how the project was born.</p>

		  		<p>In order to be able to come up with a successful design, my first step was to understand what osteoarthritis is and the impact it can have on the life of a patient. I did some literature research into the subject and I also interviewed a number of experts — among them a rheumatologist, a specialized nurse and a motion researcher. This lead to a number of important findings.</p>

		  		<p>After looking at the impact of osteoarthritis on the life of the patient, I investigated the broader perspective of the doctor. I focused on understanding the current healthcare system and some of its disadvantages — especially in relation to chronic diseases — and the possible role of eHealth in addressing those disadvantages.</p>
		  		<p>During this research I found some shortcomings in the medical model. It has been very successful in curing disease, but not necessarily in preventing and dealing with chronic disease. While life expectancy has grown enormously, so has the number of people with at least one chronic disease. Part of this is that the improved lifestyle and environment required for dealing with chronic diseases can not be realized through a few visits to the doctor a year. This is also where there is a possible role for eHealth, which may help in the transition to a new form of healthcare that is not exclusively focused on curing diseases.</p>

		  		<p>With a bigger understanding of osteoarthritis, of the healthcare system and of eHealth, the next step was to understand how to motivate someone to change his or her behavior. With this goal in mind I did a literature study into the history of behavior research and behavior change theories. I spent a lot of time researching the topic because it is interesting, difficult and also the key to a successful design. </p>
		  		<p>I looked at anything from from research on conditioning during the time of behaviorism, to the modern theories of social cognitive theory and self-determination theory, theories about goal-directed and habitual processes, about heuristics and biases and about narrative and transportation. It would to be to expansive to post all of the findings from this research, but the major findings can be found below.</p>

		  		<p>In the final part of the research phase I focused on finding out how all the previously gained knowledge could be used with the help of gamification. Gamification is the use of game elements in a non-game context. What I am focusing on is a persuasive game. Persuasive game design is game design that aims to create a user experienced game world which changes the user behavior in the real world. This happens with a transfer effect: the effect of an experienced game world on the behavior or attitude of the user in the real world.</p>

					<div>
						<h4>Motivation treasure hunt</h4>
						The idea behind this concept is to get motivated by starting. Every physical activity leads to a ‘motivation’ as a reward. This can be a self-recorded message, a funny cat video, encouragement by a friend or many other things. The focus of this concept is on structure, self-efficacy and variable rewards.

					<div>
						<h4>Chased</h4>
						This concept is based on a metaphor, where you are a character in the game and you are being chased by the pain, stiffness, fatigue and other personal factors relating to your disease. By keeping track of these factors you can get an overview of everything that is bothering you and when this occurs. The focus of the concept is on treating the factors themselves (means to end), fun and on creating the right challenge.

						<h4>Bluff</h4>
						This is a so-called shell game, based on the card game <em>lying</em>. In this concept at the end of every week at a predetermined time, there is a game with other players. Until that game starts, you have a week to unlock cards. You can unlock a card by completing a challenge. These challenges are linked to physical challenges. Unlocking cards can help you win the game at the end of the week. The focus of this concept is on the social part, creating a deadline, changing the focus (means to an end) and fun.

		  		<p>I chose the second concept — chased — as the direction to move forward with. The reason for this choice was because this concept focused more than others on the intrinsic motivation of the patients, as opposed to external rewards, and thus fit best in the design vision.</p>
		  		<p>Having chosen a concept, I started to further develop it. This development was based on the existing design vision, on more in-depth research and on discussions with the partners in the project.</p>
		  		<p>The narrative of the game was further developed based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell">Joseph Campbell</a>'s idea of a common template for a broad category of stories based around a hero named the <a href="https://www.bol.com/nl/f/the-hero-with-a-thousand-faces/30224691/">Hero's Journey</a>. I chose the template of the Hero's Journey as a basis for the narrative in the game. Apart from that I made the idea of being chased by different personal factors into a narrative where the the overall burden of the disease is the starting point and different factors can be split of.</p>

		  		<p>My next step was to find out whether the goal of the design can be achieved in its current form, and in what way the effectiveness of the design can be improved. I conducted a user test in order to evaluate the effect of the design.</p>
		  		<p>I selected four participants. All of them were diagnosed with osteoarthritis, under the age of 70 and they had no history of surgical treatment related to osteoarthritis. The user test consisted of three parts: a first part where I visited the participants and observed the participant’s first experience with the app, a second part where the participant used the app for 15 days on their own and a final part where I interviewed the participants about the app.</p>

		  		<p>The study resulted in eighteen important findings about the usability and effectiveness of the prototype in achieving the design goal. I clustered these findings in five categories. These findings were used to create a sample redesign and a number of recommendations on how to move forward with all the knowledge gained from this project.</p>
